      <h1>Rejection is hard</h1>
      </section>
      <p id="date">January 22, 2024</p>
      <section id="articleSection">
        <p>We are taight rejection at an early age when we want to do something or get something and our parents say "no".</p>
        <p>Rejection happens when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>we are aimimg for a certain grade in school and we don't get it.</li>
          <li>you want a boyfriend/girlfriend and he/she says "no. I don't like you in that way."</li>
          <li>you go through an interview process for a job and you don't get the position.</li>
          <li>when you work so hard to get a client and your proposal gets rejected.</li>
          <li>when you try to get admissions in a university for higher education and don't get the admissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the root of it all, we all want something so bad and when life says no, you can't have it, we get mad and either take it out on someone else, something else or worse, ourselves.</p>
        <p>Rejection is part of life and its okay to be rejected.</p>
